#CGCookie Replier 0.8.13 (Beta)

### A simple Chrome Extension to check the questions on the website, cgcookie.com, and look for those questions with zero replies.

The CGCReplier extension allows you to watch the questions that come in on all of the different courses, as well as lessons within the flows*, and alert you when there are questions without any replies at all.

\* Even though it is current set to only watch the flows, adding other courses to watch is as easy as adding... well.... the course URL.

## Install

* Download the [CGCReplier.crx](https://github.com/3DEsprit/CGCReplier/blob/master/CGCReplier.crx) to a folder that you can access after
* Go to the Options menu (three vertical dots) > More tools > Extensions, or simply type in the URL [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions)
* Drag and Drop the [CGCReplier.crx](https://github.com/3DEsprit/CGCReplier/blob/master/CGCReplier.crx) file from your folder on to the Extensions Page

## How to Use

Using this is very simple. You will notice the Icon's badge (square at bottom-right corner), number total rise as questions are checked, showing you how many questions are available. To see the questions, click on the icon to see the list of questions, and click each one to go straight to that page.

### Getting Set Up with The Options

By Default all topics are turned off so you will need to visit the extensions page, and choose the topic(s) you want observe.

_Note: While there are many unanswered questions, it is suggested to choose only one topic until questions are much more sparse. You can always switch topics around in the options when needed._

*Interval Time*

You may also want to set how often you want the extension to check for new replies, and this can be be anywhere between 5 and 999 minutes. Note that anything lower than 5 will default to 5, and if the interval is set to zero, the default setting of 15 minutes will be used instead. If you ever want to fast-track a search, you can change the interval, and after you close the options the extension will search unanswered questions once the built-in timer notices the change (within 15 seconds).

*Notifications*

You can also enable desktop notifications for this extension, and when turned on, it will let you know when there are unanswered questions after each interval. This may not be the best option except when it's at a point of waiting for new questions.

## Extra Features

* Settings are saved with sync data, so you can enjoy the same options across all browsers.
